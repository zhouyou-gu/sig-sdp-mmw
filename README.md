## Installation
Clone this repo and run the following to fetch the [NS-3 codes](https://github.com/zhouyou-gu/ns-3-dev-ac-grl-wi-fi/tree/ns3-sparse-wi-fi) for this project.
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html) and [NVIDIA Drivers](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/nvidia-drivers-installation)

Install python packages
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### NS-3 Related Installation

On Ubuntu (or WSL on Windows), install the ns3 and ns3gym dependency as (double check "protoc --version" and make the version match the python protobuf version). If not, the communication between ns-3 and algorithms will not be connected.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ python3 python3-pip cmake ninja-build ccache
sudo apt-get install libzmq5 libzmq3-dev
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev
sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
sudo apt-get install pkg-config
```

On MAC, install the ns3 and ns3gym dependency as (env parameters are needed to be re-exported for a new terminal).
```bash
brew install cmake gcc pkg-config protobuf protobuf-c ninja zeromq cppzmq ccache

ls -l /opt/homebrew/lib/libprotobuf.dylib
ls -l /opt/homebrew/lib/libzmq.dylib
```

<mark>If the modification on ns-3 submodule is needed, ensure that the submodule is checked out to a branch other than a detached head; otherwise, the modification will be tracked by git.<mark>

### Compiling NS-3

<mark>Change the working directory to [controller](controller)</mark>


(Optional) Now, you can have a test on whether the codes are correctly connected to the torch installation as 
```bash
PYTHONPATH=./ python3 util_script/cuda_test.py
```
or
```bash
PYTHONPATH=./ python3 util_script/apple_test.py
```
(Optional) an example return looks like the following, but it depends on your system.
```
torch.version 1.12.0+cu116
torch.cuda.is_available() True
torch.cuda.current_device() 0
torch_geometric.__version__ 2.1.0
```

(On MAC) Before the compilation of ns-3, MAC OS needs the following env parameters.

```bash
export CPATH="/opt/homebrew/include:$CPATH"
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="/opt/homebrew/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/lib $LDFLAGS"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/include $CPPFLAGS"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/homebrew:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH"
export LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"
```

Next, configure and compile NS-3
```bash
PYTHONPATH=./ python3 util_script/configure_ns3.py
```

```bash
PYTHONPATH=./ python3 util_script/build_ns3.py
```

```bash
PYTHONPATH=./ python3 util_script/install_ns3gym.py
```

## Reproducing Results in the Paper
All Results in the paper can be reproduced using the scripts in [controller/sim_alg](controller/sim_alg)

The terminology in the codes and the paper are slightly different. Some mapping between the variables in codes and the terms in the paper are listed as follows. GGM<=>Neural Graph Modeling, Tokenizer<=>State Embedding, Sparser<=>Deep Hashing Function.

## Recommended Development Setup

Clone the repo and its submodule; Install the dependency; Open the repo using vscode, where [.vscode](.vscode) contains the python path configurations, so the scripts can be simply clicked to be run. Note that on MAC OS, the env parameters still need to be exported as above when compiling the NS-3.
